ImageCompression
================

State first: the code cannot be referred.

It is a project in my first-year graduate student in Dartmouth College.


Use Vector Quantization to compress images simply. It has some damages for the picture, so the compressed picture cannot be uncompressed. But the algorithm is good for turn a picture to black-white. It is interesting! Just like I am making something inside Photoshop!
